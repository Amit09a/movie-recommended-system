ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System â€” Project Description
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python. The goal of the project is to suggest movies to users based on a selected title, using similarity-based machine learning techniques.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured a raw movie dataset by handling missing values and normalizing relevant features.

ML Model Integration: Developed a content-based recommendation engine using techniques like cosine similarity and feature extraction (e.g., genres, keywords, cast).

Backend with Python: Built the backend logic using Python and served the recommendation model via a local API.

Frontend with Streamlit (or specify if itâ€™s HTML/CSS/JS): Created a simple and interactive user interface where users can search for a movie and view the top 5 recommended movies.

API Integration: Integrated The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie posters and metadata dynamically.

Complete in PyCharm: The entire project, including model training, API handling, and frontend, was developed and run in the PyCharm environment.

ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies:
Python

Pandas, Scikit-learn

Streamlit / Flask (depending on your interface)

Requests, Pickle (for model loading)

TMDb API

PyCharm IDE

ðŸš€ Outcome:
Users can enter a movie name and get a visually rich list of similar movies recommended instantly, enhancing the movie discovery experience.
